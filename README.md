# Airbnb_2016_Analysis_Tableau

This self-project analyzes a large publicly available dataset containing Airbnb data in Seattle.

The use case of this project was a hypothetical scenario where a potential business may be looking to enter the Airbnb business in Seattle, hence are requesting useful data visualizations and analyses to help make data-driven and informed decisions.

(The dataset can be accessed on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset/code)

With this hypothetical scenario, the 3 datasets were joined (inner joins) using their listing ID's, and 5 useful figures were created and compiled into a dashboard for an entire overview of all the findings.

The dashboard can be viewed in the attached .twb file.
